# Installation

Ghaf supports both conventional installation method using an image with all
required dependencies, or a NixOS-like non-interactive, declarative installer.
This is possible with the [Ghaf as
Library](https://github.com/tiiuae/ghaf/pull/ghaf-based-project.md) approach:
rather than clicking similar options during installation, you can configure the
system once and deploy this configuration to the desired machines.

To implement the pre-configured setting up approach, we used the
[nixos-anywhere](https://github.com/nix-community/nixos-anywhere) tool.

Following are descriptions of ways of installing Ghaf.

## Wizard

See [wizard documentation](https://github.com/tiiuae/ghaf-installation-wizard) for usage guide.

## Manual

To install Ghaf manually:

1. Create your own flake using the Ghaf template:

```sh
nix flake init -t github:tiiuae/ghaf#target-x86_64-generic
```

2. Edit it according to your preferences.

3. Set the value of `ghaf.installer.sshKeys` to get an installer image. If you don't have ssh keys follow substeps:

    1. Generate an SSH keypair as follows:

         ```
         $ ssh-keygen -t ed25519
         Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.
         Enter file in which to save the key (/home/user/.ssh/id_ed25519): /home/user/.ssh/id_ed25519_installer
         Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
         Enter same passphrase again:
         Your identification has been saved in /home/user/.ssh/id_ed25519_installer
         Your public key has been saved in /home/user/.ssh/id_ed25519_installer.pub
         ...
         ```

    2. Copy public key from file (`id_ed25519_installer.pub` in an example above) in place of stub in `flake.nix` of your configuration.

4. Build the installer image:

```sh
nix build .#nixosConfigurations.PROJ_NAME-ghaf-debug.config.system.build.installer
```

5. Flash the installer image to your device (temporary storage which will be used to establish connection with the host machine):

```sh
sudo dd if=./result/iso/nixos-...-linux.iso of=/dev/YOUR_DEVICE conv=sync && sync
```

6. Run the image on the device.

7. Connect the device to the network using `wifi-connector`.

8. Check the target block device name using the lsblk command and put it in the disk configuration option in `flake.nix`.

8. Install the NixOS configuration to the target device using the command:

```sh
nix run github:nix-community/nixos-anywhere -- --flake .#CONFIGURATION_NAME root@IP_ADDRESS
```

## Standalone

In case you want to install your system without a network, you can create standalone installer â€” a Ghaf image which will contain all required dependencies of your system beforehand.

To use it follow those steps:

1. Build installer:

```sh
nix build github:tiiuae/ghaf#lenovo-x1-carbon-gen11-release-installer
```

2. Flash it to the device:

```
sudo dd if=./result/iso/nixos-...-linux.iso of=/dev/YOUR_DEVICE conv=sync && sync
```

3. Run the image on the device.

4. Choose drive on which Ghaf will be installed.

5. Reboot.

6. Enjoy!

This method is currently available only for the predefined configuration of `lenovo-x1` target, but if you're familiar enough with nix, you can mimic code that was written in [corresponding target file](https://github.com/tiiuae/ghaf/commit/4e9b79a95de8140be9d830b9db2cf0147e7d6192#diff-789892fdf4e4c650d81ce42dbc84586807ced5e73a8d53c06775acf7df2d0876R512-R555).
